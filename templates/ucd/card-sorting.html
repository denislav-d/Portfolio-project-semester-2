          <h2>Card sorting workshop</h2>
          <p>
            This week we had the exercise to do card sorting of a website of our
            choice. Our group chose the ‘Kruidvat’ website, since we knew that
            more people prefer to use its physical stores, instead of ordering
            online, and our goal was to discover what might be wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first participants were asked to sort the topics from the mixed
            pink notes into the pre-defined categories. You can see the result
            to the right. Although there were some differences, most of the
            content was placed in the same places as on the website, which means
            that the user could easily find the product they are searching for.
          </p>
          <p>Open card sorting exercise below &darr;</p>

          <h2>Open card sorting</h2>
          <p>You can see the results of open card sorting to the left.</p>
          <p>
            The differences are obvious this time, as there are some categories
            with way less content and one category with too many sticky notes.
            They put more stickies in the ‘Care and Hygiene’ category, which
            made sense to both them and us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Corresponding to the results and feedback from the closed card
            sorting, users found it confusing to have only two food related
            sticky notes, but still put them into their own category. Again, the
            ‘Baby and Child’ category was the easiest.
          </p>
          <p>Conclusion and reflection below &darr;</p>

          <h2>Conclusion and reflection</h2>
          <p>
            In conclusion, most of the categories are sorted quite well on the
            website as the average user can navigate to their desired product.
            For food products like ‘Snacks and Sweets’, ‘Coffee and Tea’, it
            would better to be assigned into their own category or just into the
            ‘More’ section, instead of being in ‘Home and Cleaning’.
          </p>

          <p>
            My reflection from this exercise was to always do a good amount of
            different user testing, like card sorting, because there are always
            flaws which even the best designers can miss. I also learned that it
            is better to invest in creating and designing a new category even if
            there are only a couple of matching products for it. This way, you
            can save a lot of user effort and improve your design.
